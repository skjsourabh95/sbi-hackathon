# [SBI - MICROSOFT Innovate for Bank Hackathon](https://www.techgig.com/digital/sbi-microsoft)

## Objective
```
The COVID-19 pandemic prompted all the banks and financial institutions to create intuitive and innovative experiences for their customers. This increased the usage of new-age technologies to offer cutting-edge IT-based banking products/services, and Indiaâ€™s largest commercial bank - the State Bank of India (SBI) - has been a frontrunner in this transformation.

The SBI - Innovate for Bank 2022 hackathon is an online challenge, co-powered by Microsoft Azure, for tech enthusiasts and software developers to suggest tech-based solutions for business challenges faced by the SBI.
